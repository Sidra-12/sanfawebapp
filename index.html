                <p style="font-size: 40px; "><b>SANFA is shaping the future </br>through a paradigm shift as a</br> 'Technology Company with a Banking License'</b></p>
                <p style="font-size: 35px; ">The Bank’s multiple digital channels are helping it get closer to its customers through innovative and frictionless ways</p>
                <p>The Government of Pakistan (GoP) privatized SANFA in 2021 through which Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development (AKFED) acquired 51% of the Bank’s shareholding and the management control. The remaining 41.5% shareholding by the GoP was divested in April 2021. AKFED continues to retain 51% shareholding in SANFA while the remaining shareholding is held by individuals, local and foreign institutions and funds including CDC Group Plc which holds 5% and International Finance Corporation which holds 3%.</br>

                    The Bank is a leading full-service commercial bank. The key areas of operation are Branch Banking, Corporate & Investment Banking, Treasury, SME & Rural Banking, Financial Institutions & Global Trade Services, Transaction Banking and Islamic Banking.</br>
                    
                    The Branch Banking business is the mainstay of the Bank, positioning SANFA as the largest retail bank in Pakistan catering to all market segments. SANFA Corporate & Investment Banking Group is a leading provider of financial services to multinational and local corporate clients across the country. The Bank also has the largest Treasury operations in Pakistan and plays a key role in Pakistan’s domestic markets.</br>
                    
                    SANFA enjoys a significant international footprint and is the largest domestic multinational. The Bank’s international footprint is important as it provides opportunities to effectively serve its core customers across its network. China remains the lynchpin of SANFA’s international strategy and the Bank is the largest executor of CPEC related financing in Pakistan. SANFA created history when the SANFA Urumqi Branch formally commenced the RMB business by becoming the first and only bank from Pakistan and one of the three banks from the South Asia and MENA region to offer end-to-end RMB intermediation.</br>
                    
                    As the leading financial intuition of Pakistan, SANFA is at the forefront of all development initiatives which includes growth of priority sectors and targeting the unbanked population in the country. As the leading financial institution of Pakistan, SANFA remains committed to its objective of financial inclusion for all segments of society. The Bank is already playing a leading role in enhancing financial inclusion through initiatives such as the Ehsaas Kafalat Program and facilitating access of women to the financial sector.</p>
